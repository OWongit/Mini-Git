# Mini-Git
This project is a simplified version of a Git-like version control system, implemented with linked lists. The 'Repository' class keeps track of commitsâ€”each containing a unique ID, a message, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous commit. The class provides operations for creating new commits, removing existing commits, viewing commit history, and synchronizing commits between two repositories. This mini-Git focuses on metadata and commit tracking (rather than tracking file changes) and is tested via a provided client program.
