# Mini-Git
This project is a simplified implementation of a Git-like version control system using linked lists. The Repository class manages commits, each containing a unique ID, a message, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous commit. The class supports operations such as creating new commits, removing existing commits, viewing commit history, and synchronizing commits between two repositories. This mini-Git focuses on metadata and commit tracking (rather than tracking file changes) and is tested using a provided client program.
